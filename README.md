### Hey there!

I'm a Computing and Software Systems graduate from the University of Melbourne.

### Current Projects

My current projects focus is on OpenGL, web development and audio plugin development. Any programming project with a creative side are my favourites to tackle, my pinned repositories are a good reflection of my current programming interests.
